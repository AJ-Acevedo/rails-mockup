## Ruby on Rails 4.0.0 and Bootstrap 3.0 Mockup


This is a simple Ruby on Rails app to mockup a site using bootstrap 3.0-wip.  
Just some basic routing, a few controllers, some view files, and the compiled bootstrap assets.  



###Getting the latest version of bootstrap 3.0

clone the 3.0 repo [https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/3.0.0-wip]([https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/3.0.0-wip)  
`npm install`  
`make bootstrap`  
Then copy the contents of  
bootstrap/js -> app/assets/javascript/bootstrap  
bootstrap/img -> app/assets/images/bootstrap  
bootstrap/css -> app/assets/css/bootstrap
